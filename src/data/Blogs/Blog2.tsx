        The MX3 Hydration Testing System offers a revolutionary, science-backed solution to monitor
        and manage workforce hydration levels in real time.
      </p>

      <p className="font-bold">Why Hydration Matters in the Workplace</p>

      <p>
        {"Hydration affects cognitive function, physical performance, and safety. For workers in construction, mining, oil &amp; gas, and emergency response, dehydration can lead to fatigue, dizziness, and increased risk of injury."}
      </p>

      <p className="font-bold">How the MX3 Hydration Testing System Works</p>

      <p>
        {"Using a small sample of saliva, the MX3 system delivers rapid hydration analysis directly on-site. It's non-invasive, portable, and connects to a digital dashboard for tracking workforce health trends."}
      </p>

      <p className="font-bold">Real-Time Insights for Safety Managers</p>

      <p>
        By identifying hydration issues early, managers can take immediate action to protect workers
        and maintain productivity. MX3 provides data-driven solutions for safety and HR teams to
        meet occupational health standards.
