        GHS-8AT-EX â€“ Explosion-Proof Gas Sampling Pump
      </p>

      <p className="text-justify">
        The <strong>GASTEC GHS-8AT-EX</strong> is a precision-engineered,
        explosion-proof gas sampling pump designed for reliable use in hazardous and
        flammable environments. Built to meet strict EX-rated (explosion protection)
        standards, it is ideal for safety-critical operations across industries such
        as oil &amp; gas, petrochemicals, mining, and confined space entry.
