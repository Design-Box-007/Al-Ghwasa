                Ghwasa has been the factory-authorized distributor of GASTEC gas detection
                products in the Middle East for over a decade. Known for competitive
                pricing, fast service, and industry-leading reliability, Ghwasa is the go-to
                supplier for industrial gas detection solutions across various sectors.

                GASTEC standard detector tubes are precision-engineered glass tubes with
                printed calibration scales, designed for quick and accurate on-site gas
                analysis.
            </p>
            <p className="text-justify">
                The GASTEC gas detection system includes the GV-100S/GV-110S gas sampling
                pump and compatible detector tubes. This method allows for a fast, easy, and
                cost-effective way to monitor toxic gases and vapors in industrial
                environments.
            </p>
            <p className="text-justify">
                With a shelf life of up to 3 years, the tubes are ideal for long-term
                storage and use. Operators can instantly read gas concentrations on the tube
                and analyze a wide range of gases with high accuracy. To use, simply break
                both ends of the tube, insert it into the GV-100S/110S pump, and begin
                sampling.
