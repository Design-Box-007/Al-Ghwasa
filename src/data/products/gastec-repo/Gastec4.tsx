                    The <strong>GV-100S and GV-110S gas sampling pumps</strong> feature a flow
                    finish indicator for precise measurement. The GV-110S model includes an
                    integrated counter within the industrial pump, simplifying the sampling
                    process.

                <p className="bg-white text-left mb-4 leading-[1.08]">
                    Constructed from durable HDPE plastic, the pump is resistant to
                    environmental factors such as heat and pressure. It is strong yet
                    lightweight and requires no maintenance.

                <p className="bg-white text-left mb-4 leading-[1.08]">
                    The system supports short-term gas detection tubes and includes a 30-meter
                    extension hose (model 351A-30) for extended reach. It also comes with a
                    semi-rigid carry case with a strap, lubricant, and three tube holder O-rings
                    for secure and convenient transport.

                <p className="bg-white text-left mb-4 leading-[1.08]">
                    Additionally, a variety of accessories are available to enhance detection
                    capabilities, including extension hoses, a 2.8-meter telescoping extension
                    pole, and a hot probe that delivers accurate readings without compromising
                    safety.
